Getting help and contacting playdoh devs
========================================

IRC:

    We hang out on ``#webdev`` on ``irc.mozilla.org``. That's a synchronous
    chat, so if someone doesn't answer your questions, then it's possible no
    one is around or the people who are around don't know the answer.


Mailing list:

    All security notices and playdoh project updates are sent to the `dev-webdev
    mailing list <https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-webdev>`_.

    If you use playdoh, it behooves you greatly to join this list. At the time of
    this writing, the list is pretty low traffic.


Writing up issues:

    If you find yourself stuck, write up `an issue in github
    <https://github.com/mozilla/playdoh/issues>`_.
